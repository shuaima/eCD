\label{sec-conclusion}

We have provided a way to design infinite and finite beams, and developed one-pass trajectory tracking algorithms \citt, \bitt and \sitt to effectively and efficiently track a moving object in a disc, finite beam and infinite beam, respectively.
We have also experimentally evaluated the performance of our algorithms compared with two representative trajectory tracking algorithms \ldrh (the most efficient) and \grts (currently the most effective). 
They are tens of times faster than \grts and several times slower than \ldrh.
In terms of compression and message ratios, \bitt, \citt and \sitt send fewer messages than \grts and \ldrh, and have the similar compression ratios compared with \grts.
%\sitt (using \ped) outperforms \grts in both metrics.
