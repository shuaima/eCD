\section{conclusion}
\label{sec-conclusion}

We have provided a way to design infinite and finite beams, and developed one-pass trajectory tracking algorithms \citt and \bitt to effectively and efficiently track a moving object in a disc or a beam, respectively.
We have also experimentally evaluated the performance of our algorithms \citt and \bitt compared with two representative trajectory tracking algorithms \ldrh (the most efficient) and \grts (currently the most effective) under the similar size of tracking area. 
\citt and \bitt sends fewer messages than \grts and \ldrh to MOD server;
\citt and \bitt have obviously better compression ratios than \ldrh and are comparable with \grts;
\bitt has smaller average \ped and \sed errors than \grts even it actually uses $1.6$ times \sed error bound of \grts, and \citt is comparable with \grts.
Moreover, our approaches have linear time, and are great faster than \grts.
