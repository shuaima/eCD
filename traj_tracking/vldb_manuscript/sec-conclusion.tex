\section{conclusion}
\label{sec-conclusion}

We have provided a way to design infinite and finite beams, and developed one-pass trajectory tracking algorithms \citt and \bitt to effectively and efficiently track a moving object in a disc or a beam, respectively.
We have also experimentally evaluated the performance of our algorithms \citt and \bitt compared with two representative trajectory tracking algorithms \ldrh (the most efficient) and \grts (currently the most effective) under a similar tracking area. 
In terms of message ratios, \citt and \bitt send fewer messages than \grts and \ldrh; in terms of compression ratios, \citt and \bitt are obviously better than \ldrh and comparable with \grts; in terms of errors, \bitt has smaller average \ped and \sed errors than \grts even it actually uses a larger \sed error bound, and \citt is comparable with \grts; in terms of running time, our approaches are tens of times faster than \grts.
