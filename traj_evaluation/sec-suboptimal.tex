%In particular, the state-of-the-art the sub-optimal line simplification approaches can be classified into three categories.


This section reviews compression sub-optimal algorithms solving the \emph{min-$\#$} problem of trajectory simplification, as shown in the taxonomy of Section~\ref{sec-intro}.
