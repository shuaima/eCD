% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.1 April 2013
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\begin{abstract}
Nowadays, various sensors are collecting, storing and transmitting tremendous trajectory data, and it is well-known that the storage, network bandwidth and computing resources could be heavily wasted if raw trajectory data is directly adopted. Line simplification algorithms are effective approaches to attacking this issue by compressing data points in a trajectory to a set of continuous line segments, and are commonly used in practice.
In this article,  we first classify the error bounded line simplification algorithms into different categories, and review each category of algorithms. We then study the data aging problem of line simplification  algorithms and distance metrics from the views of aging friendliness and aging error, and provide a full picture of the data aging problem. Finally, we present a systematic experimental evaluation of representative error bounded line simplification algorithms, including both optimal and sub-optimal methods, in terms of commonly adopted perpendicular Euclidean, synchronous Euclidean and direction-aware distances.
Using real-life trajectory datasets, we systematically evaluate and analyze the performance (compression ratio, average error, running time, {aging friendliness and query friendliness}) of error bounded line simplification algorithms with respect to {distance metrics,} trajectory sizes and error bounds.
Our study reveals the characteristics of error bounded line simplification algorithms, which lead to guidelines for practitioners to choose appropriate algorithms and distance metrics for specific applications.
